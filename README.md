#  Deep CNN model for time series prediction "Stock Price."
This repository contains a solution to the stock price prediction problem using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The dataset used for this project is the stock price of the Royal Dutch Shell plc from 2015 to 2020. The data was preprocessed and normalized before being used to train the model. The model was then trained using a LeNet-5 architecture with a SGD optimizer and a mean squared error loss function. The model was then tested on the test dataset and the results were visualized.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the Royal Dutch Shell plc for providing the dataset used in this project. I would also like to thank the developers of the tech stack used for this project for making it easier for me to develop the solution.
